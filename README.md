# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Introduction

This test project aims to create a project that uses all possible React hooks, Javascript concepts, tailwind/css features, and html tags. This is to apply what I learned in the tutorials and serves as a reference for future projects.

# Concepts used

The project is able to utilize different React / JavaScript concepts such as:

1. **React reusable components** to build UI.
2. **Session storage** to store states.
3. Use **asynchronous concepts** (asynch/await) and **fetchAPI** to obtain data from an API.
4. Different **react hooks** to store data and perform side effects.
